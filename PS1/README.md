From the genData.R file, the main function requires four arguments, slice, save, plot, and seed. The first argument, slice, determines the step size of the sequence that generates the data. I recommend using a number between 0.1 and 0.001, and the default value is 0.01. The second argument, save, when true, returns a csv file of the data generated. The third argument returns a plot of the data, when true. The last argument, seed, allows users to select the seed.
